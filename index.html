            This guide is being written with the assumption that you are using Visual Studio Code or that you are using the command line interface for git, and that your repository 
            is residing on GitHub. If this is not the case, then the configuration and set-up sections may not be of value, but the principles covered later in the guide should 
            still be applicable.
