                This guide is being written with the assumption that you are using Visual Studio Code or that you are using the command line interface for git, and that your repository 
                is residing on GitHub. If this is not the case, then the configuration and set-up sections may not be of too much value, but the principles covered later in the guide should 
                still be applicable.

                There are a number of topics that are sufficiently covered by other articles or guides. Links to these guides are provided within this document as there is no need to 
                reinvent the wheel.

                <span class="whathigo">What The Heck Is Going On</span> a little. These sections are optional but definitely worth a look at for better understanding.

              <p class="p">
                The very first thing you will need to do is install git, VS Code (or the editor of your choice), and configure them. There are plenty of resources available to help you set up git on your computer. 
                Below are links to articles that will help you get git configured to work with your IDE. As there are too many to mention in the scope of this guide, only a few of the most 
                relevant to web development are listed.

              <h4 class="h4">Git Bash</h4>
              <p class="p">
                If you're on a Windows device and will be using the terminal within your editor, it may be a good idea to install Git Bash. Windows users can perform command-line 
                operations using the Command Prompt or Powershell, and some developers swear by them, but Git Bash works much more like what you would see on a Mac or Linux environment. 
                It is specifically designed to work with git and is easy to use. 
              </p>

              <p class="p">
                If you're on MacOs or Linux you probably already have Bash. Newer Apple devices are favoring a newer CLI called zsh. For the most part, the commands will work the 
                same as Bash. If you want to use Bash, you may need to update it. See the link below.
              </p>

              <h3 class="h3">What IS Git?</h3>
                <p class="p">
                  Git is a Distributed Version Control System. It is the most widely used DVCS in the world. Git is NOT GitHub, but GitHub works off of Git. More on that later.
                </p>
    
              <h4 class="h4">Version Control</h4>
              <p class="p">
                Version control is all about keeping track of changes to software. Before version control, you often had to save several different previous copies of the same file if 
                you wanted to revert to a previous change. And what if you wanted to revert several changes all at once? And if you're working on a team, how do you know who changed what 
                and when? With Git, you only have one file you're working on, and every time you "commit" a change, it stores the previous version of the file you altered as well as a 
                lot of meta data about the changes. You will know who changed what, when, and, if they're doing it right, why.
              </p>
    
              <h4 class="h4">Distributed</h4>
              <p class="p">
                Distributed means that there is a full copy of the repository on every computer that has cloned it. This copy even includes ALL of the history. Every change made by every 
                team member can be accessed on your local computer, even without an internet connection. Changes made to the online repository will still need to be downloaded to your 
                local computer, but there is a process for that. You can still make your changes offline on your local device and then push to your teams online repository when you're 
                online.

            <h3 class="h3">To Terminal, or Not To Terminal</h3>
            <p>
              When working with Git in VS Code you have the option of using either a terminal (or command line) interface or by using VS Code's integrated git controls. If you're a 
              little intimidated by using the command line at first, that's fine. However, you will probably be expected to know the terminal commands by a future employer so it 
              is recommended you start practicing with it soon. Both methods will be covered side-by-side in this guide so if you want to work with the integrated controls at first 
              to get a fundamental understanding of what you're doing, you can then go back and level up later by comparing the two methods.

            <h3 class="h3">Branches</h3>
            <p>
              Under Construction: Branches are sort of like copies of a repo but, unlike forks, they are not separate copies, but copies that are stored in the original repo. There 
              is a lot more nuance to it, but that's essentially what they are. Branches are so that someone can work on the code in an encapsulated environment without effecting 
              other's code and nobody's code effecting  theirs.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will want to do your work on a branch nobody else is working on. This will make your merges much easier. This is explained in the section on merges. There are 
              two ways listed on how to create and checkout a branch from an existing repository. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="h4">Branching directly from GitHub</h4>
            <p>
              From your repositories main page on GitHub, you will click on the "main" icon. Type in the name of the branch into the text field. If the branch doesn't exist, you 
              will be given an option to create one. Click on "Create branch: (branch name) from 'main'".
            </p>

            <p>
              You will now need to pull the change down to your editor. In VS Code, you will need to switch to the source control tab on the left. Click on the ellipsis at the top, 
              then click on pull. This will pull all changes online into the repository clone on your computer. This will include the new branch online. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="h4">Branching in VS Code</h4>  
            <p>
              Click on the "source control" icon on the bottom left that says master (master is the name of the branch you're on).
